Inversion Queries
You are given a permutation array
A of integers in the range
[1,N].
Your task is to handle
Q queries of the following type:
Given
L and
R, first create a new array
B, also of length
N, according to the following:
B
i
=L if
A
i
<L.
B
i
=A
i
if
L≤A
i
≤R
B
i
=R if
R<A

.
Find the number of inversions

in
B.

†
An inversion is a pair
(i,j) such that
1≤i<j≤N and
B
i
>B
j
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N and
Q - the size of the array and the number of queries.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, the array.
The next
Q lines contain
2 integers each -
L and
R, the parameters for each query.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line the number of inversions in the constructed array
B.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The constructed array
B is
[4,2,3,5,1,6]. The inversion pairs are
(1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5) and
(4,5).
Test Case 2 : The constructed array
B is
[4,3,3,5,3,6]. The inversion pairs are
(1,2),(1,3),(1,5) and
(4,5).
