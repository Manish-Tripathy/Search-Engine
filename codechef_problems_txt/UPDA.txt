Updating A
Alice and Bob have an array of
A of
N elements, and will play a game on it. They alternate turns, with Alice going first.
On each turn:
Let
M denote the current length of
A.
If
M=1, the game stops. Otherwise, the current player must make a move.
On Alice's turn, she must choose integers
L and
R (
1≤L<R≤M), delete the elements
A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
from the array,
and insert
∣A
L
+A
L+1
+…+A
R
∣ in their place.
Note that
∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of
x.
On Bob's turn, he must choose integers
L and
R (
1≤L<R≤M), delete the elements
A
L
,A
L+1
,…,A
R
from the array, and insert
(A
L
+A
L+1
+…+A
R
) in their place.
That is, Alice must choose some subarray, delete it, and insert the absolute value of its sum in its place.
Bob will do the same, but insert just the sum (and not its absolute value).
Note that since
L<R, the length of the array will decrease after each move.
Alice wants to maximize the value of the final element, while Bob wants to minimize it.
If both Alice and Bob make their moves optimally, what will the value of the final element be?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N — the number of elements in
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, denoting the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the value of the final element if both players move optimally.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The array is already of length
1, so no moves will be made.
Test case
2: Since
L<R, Alice has no choice but to choose the entire array
[5,−7] and replace it with
∣5+(−7)∣=2, at which point the game ends.
Test case
3: One possible sequence of moves is as follows:
Alice chooses
L=5 and
R=6, replacing the subarray
[−2,−1] with its absolute sum
3.
The array is now
A=[1,1,−2,5,3].
Bob chooses
L=2 and
R=4, replacing the subarray
[1,−2,5] with its sum
4.
The array is now
A=[1,4,3].
Alice chooses
L=2 and
R=3, turning the array into
A=[1,7].
Bob chooses
L=1 and
R=2, turning the array into
A=[8].
