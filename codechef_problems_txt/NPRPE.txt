Not Prime Permutation
You are given a permutation
P of the integers
{1,2,3,…N}.
Find any permutation
A of
{1,2,…,N} such that, for every index
i (
1≤i≤N),
A
i
+P
i
is not a prime number.
If no such permutation
A exists, print
−1 instead.
Note: A permutation of
{1,2,…,N} is an array of length
N that contains every integer from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N, the length of the permutation
P.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the permutation you found.
If no such
A exists, print
−1 instead.
If there are multiple possible solutions, you may print any of them.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The only choice is
A=[1], which doesn't work because
A
1
+P
1
=1+1=2 is a prime.
Test case
2: There are two choices:
A=[1,2] and
A=[2,1]. It can be verified that neither of them work (either
2 or
3 will appear as a sum).
Test case
3: We have
P=[2,5,1,3,4]. Let
A=[4,1,5,3,2], then it can be seen that
A
i
+P
i
=6 for every
i; and
6 is not a prime.
Test case
4: For
P=[6,3,1,5,2,4] and
A=[3,6,5,1,4,2], the
A
i
+P
i
values are
[9,9,6,6,6,6] — none of which are prime.
