Even Sum Subarray
Given an array
A of size
N, find the size of the largest subarray of
A which has an even sum.
For example, for the array
[2,1,2] the answer is just
1 as the largest subarray with an even sum is
[2].
Note that a subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For the array
[1,3,2], some possible subarrays are
[1],[2],[1,3],[1,3,2]. However,
[1,2] is not a subarray for this array.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the size of the array.
The next line contains
N space-separated integer -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A

.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the size of the largest subarray with even sum.
