FightBots
Alice and Bob are competing in the finals of a FightBots tournament.
The match takes place on the
2-D plane.
Alice's robot starts at position
(0,0), while Bob's starts at position
(X,Y).
It is guaranteed that
(X,Y)

=(0,0).
The match lasts for
N seconds. Every second, both robots must move exactly one unit up, down, left, or right. The two robots may move in different directions.
Alice has a string
S of length
N containing only the characters
{L,R,U,D}, and has decided that she will move according to it.
That is, if
S
i
=R, Alice will move her robot one unit right in the
i-th second. This means the
x-coordinate of Alice's robot will increase by
1.
Similarly, the characters
L, U, D correspond to left (
x-coordinate decreases by
1), up (
y-coordinate increases by
1), and down (
y-coordinate decreases by
1) movements of one unit, respectively.
If both robots are at the same location after some moves have been made, Bob wins (even if less than
N seconds have passed). If
N seconds pass without this happening, Alice wins.
Does Bob have a sequence of moves that will allow him to win?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers
N,X, and
Y — the length of the match, and the coordinates of Bob's initial position.
The second line contains a string
S of length
N, denoting the sequence of moves Alice will make.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: Yes if Bob has a sequence of moves that will allow him to win, and No otherwise.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings NO, no, No, and nO will all be treated as equivalent.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice's sequence of moves is
RRDLU.
Her robot will thus follow the path
(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,−1)→(1,−1)→(1,0).
Bob starts at
(2,4). If he follows the path
DDLDD, his robot will move as:
(2,4)→(2,3)→(2,2)→(1,2)→(1,1)→(1,0).
At the end of the
5-th move, both robots are at
(1,0), so Bob wins.
Test case
2: Alice's sequence of moves is
RRDU.
Her robot will thus follow the path
(0,0)→(1,0)→(2,0)→(2,−1)→(2,0).
Even though Bob's robot starts at
(1,0), since he must move every second, he can never be on the same position as Alice.
Test case
3: Bob starts too far away from Alice.
Test case
4: Bob can move as
LDU. After the second move, both robots will be at
(0,0) so Bob wins.
