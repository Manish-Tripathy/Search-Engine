Empty the String
You are given a string
S, which contains only characters,
A and
B, and can perform the following operation :
Choose an alternating subsequence
T of
S, and delete it from
S.
For example, if our string is ABBA, we can choose ABBA, and delete the bolded characters to get B.
Let
f(S)= the minimum number of operations to convert
S to an empty string.
Given a string
S of length
N, find
f(S).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the length of the string
S.
The second line contains a binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line
f(S), i.e. the minimum number of operations to convert
S to an empty string.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : We can choose the whole string in
1 operation because it is alternating and delete it.
Test Case 2 : All characters are same, so we can only delete
1 character each time. Thus, the minimum operations is
3.
