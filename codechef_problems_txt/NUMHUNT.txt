Number Hunt
Given a positive integer
X, find the smallest positive integer
Y satisfying all of the following conditions:
Y should not be a prime;
Y should not be a perfect square;
No factor of
Y other than
1 is less than
X.
Note that
Y might not fit in a
32 bit integer.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a positive integer
X as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the smallest positive integer
Y satisfying the given conditions.
Note that
Y might not fit in a
32 bit integer.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Let us consider all values of
Y in increasing order:
Y=2: It is a prime.
Y=3: It is a prime.
Y=4: It is a perfect square
(4=2
2
).
Y=5: It is a prime.
Y=6: It is neither prime, nor a perfect square. The non-
1 factors of
6 are
2,3 and
6, none of which are less than
X=1.
Thus,
6 is the smallest integer satisfying the given conditions.
Test case
2:
Y=6 has non-
1 factors
2,3, and
6, none of which are less than
X=2.
Test case
3: The smallest integer satisfying the conditions is
15. The non-
1 factors of
15 are
3,5 and
15, none of which are less than
X=3.
