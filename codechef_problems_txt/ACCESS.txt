Access Control
Chef is a visitor in CodeChef's new office. All doors inside the office require a swipe of access card.
The access card allows a fixed number of swipes and expires after that.
You are given a binary string
S of length
N and an integer
X.
Let
S
i
=0 denote the swipe of access card, thus reducing the remaining swipes by
1; and
S
i
=1 denote a renewal of access card which sets the remaining swipes to
X.
Find whether the string
S denotes a valid string of renewal and swipes where the card never expires before a door is accessed.
Note that the access card has
0 swipes left in the beginning.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X — the length of the binary string and the number of swipes left in the access card after renewal.
The next line contains a binary string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the string
S denotes a valid string of renewal and swipes where the card never expires before a door is accessed. Otherwise output NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initially card has
0 swipes. Thus, Chef would not be able to access the first door.
Test case
2: Chef renews the card and thus gets
2 swipes. Thus, Chef would be able to access the next two doors. At the end, Chef renews the card again and is left with
2 swipes.
Test case
3: Chef renews the card and thus gets
1 swipe. Thus, Chef would be able to access the next door. Chef renews the card again and is able to access the next door.
Test case
4:
Chef renews the card and thus gets
2 swipes.
Chef uses a swipe to access a door.
Chef renews the card and swipes reset to
2.
Chef renews the card and swipes reset to
2.
Chef uses a swipe to access a door.
