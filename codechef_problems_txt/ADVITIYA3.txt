Cookie Day
A very caring mother has
N cookie jars with her. Each jar contains a different type of cookie.
There are
A
i
cookies in the
i-th jar.
The mother wanted to give some cookies to her
K children, and she decided to only distribute cookies of a single type. That is, she'll choose exactly one of the
N jars and distribute the cookies within it.
She'd like to ensure a couple of things:
Each child should receive at least
1 cookie.
Each child should also receive an equal number of cookies, in the spirit of fairness.
Under the above two conditions, what is the minimum number of "wasted" cookies, i.e, cookies that remain in the chosen jar after distribution?
If it is not possible to give out any cookies at all, print
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the number of cookie jars and the number of children.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,…,A

— where
A
i
is the number of cookies in the
i-th jar.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer denoting the minimum number of cookies that will go to waste.
If it is not possible to distribute the cookies at all, output
−1 instead.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The best choice would be to choose the
1
st
jar, so that
6 of the cookies will be divided among her children (each child gets
2) and only
1 goes to waste.
Test case
2: No matter which jar is chosen, it's impossible to give every child at least one cookie. So, the answer is
−1.
