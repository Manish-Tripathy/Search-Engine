Xometry (Easy Version)
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that in the easy version, all elements of
A are pairwise distinct.
You are given an array
A containing
N non-negative integers.
Count the number of ordered quadruples
(i,j,k,l) such that:
1≤i,j,k,l≤N;
The values
i,j,k,l are pairwise distinct; and
It is possible to form a rectangle
ABCD with side lengths
AB=A

as shown in the figure below:
Note that we're interested in ordered quadruples, so for example
(1,2,3,4) and
(2,1,4,3) must be counted separately if they're both valid.
Please note that all the side lengths of the rectangles must be positive.
Please note that in this version, all elements of
A are pairwise distinct.
Here,
⊕ denotes the bitwise exclusive or operation.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of elements in the array
A.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,…,A
N
— the elements of array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output the number of ordered quadruples
(i,j,k,l) that satisfy the properties on a new line.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
24 possible ordered quadruples. Two of them are:
[i,j,k,l]=[5,2,3,4]. For this AB
=5⊕2=7, BC
=2⊕3=1, CD
=3⊕4=7 and DA
=4⊕5=1. Since AB = CD and AC = BD, this is a rectangle.
[i,j,k,l]=[2,3,4,5]. For this AB
=2⊕3=1, BC
=3⊕4=7, CD
=4⊕5=1 and DA
=5⊕2=7. Since AB = CD and AC = BD, this is a rectangle.
Test case
2: There are
432 possible ordered quadruples. One of them is:
[i,j,k,l]=[3,4,6,8]. For this AB
=6⊕4=2, BC
=4⊕2=6, CD
=2⊕0=2 and DA
=0⊕6=6. Since AB = CD and AC = BD, this is a rectangle.
