Divisors Array (Hard Version)
This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between this version and the easy version is the constraints on
M and
A
i
.
Chef has received a mathematics assignment that requires array transformations.
Given an array
A of size
N and a positive integer
M, perform these steps:
First, create array
B such that
B
i
=A
i
×M! ;
(M! denotes the factorial of
M).
Then, for each element in array
B, calculate
F(B
i
), where
F(x) represents the number of divisors of
x.
Since these values can be large, output each
F(B
i
) modulo
(10
9
+7).
Input Format
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers
N and
M, as mentioned in the statement.
The second line of input contains
N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of array
A .
Output Format
Output
N space-separated integers representing
F(B
i
) modulo
(10
9
+7).

4 6 6
Explanation:
The initial array
A=[1,2,3] and
M=3. Thus
M!=3⋅2⋅1=6.
The array
B=[1⋅6,2⋅6,3⋅6]=[6,12,18].
The number of divisors of
6,12, and
18 are
4,6, and
6 respectively.
