Odd Matrix
You are given an integer
N.
Your task is to construct a matrix of size
N×N satisfying all the following conditions:
All elements are between
1 and
N
2
;
All elements are pairwise distinct;
The sum of elements in every row is odd;
The sum of elements in every column is odd.
It can be shown that under the given constraints, at least one such matrix exists for every
N.
If there are multiple answers, you may print any.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing a single integer,
N.
Output Format
For each test case, print
N lines, each containing
N integers.
The
j
th
integer of the
i
th
line must be the element in
i
th
row and
j
th
column of the matrix.
If there are multiple answers, you may print any one of them.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤300
The sum of
N
2
over all testcases does not exceed
10
5
Subtasks
Subtask 1 (49 points):
N is odd.
Subtask 2 (51 points):
N is even.

Explanation:
Test case
1: All elements of the matrix are distinct and the sum of every row and column is equal to
15. Thus, all conditions are satisfied.
