Explanation:
In the first test case, Alice can first remove a single stone from the pile bringing it to
2 stones. Then Bob is forced to remove
1 stone, and Alice is able to take the last stone.
In the second test case, Alice can take all
5 stones on her first move.
In the third test case, the entire game is forced (both players can only remove one stone) and after
10

turns, Bob takes the last stone and wins.
