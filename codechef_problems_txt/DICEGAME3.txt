Dice Game 3
Chef is playing a game consisting of
N rounds. In each round he rolls a regular six faced dice.
He starts with an initial score of
0. Let the number rolled by him in a particular round be
X.
If this is not the first round and the previous number rolled was
1, Chef will add
2⋅X to his score, otherwise he will add
X to his score.
For example, if the game has
6 rounds and the rolls are
[2,1,6,1,1,4] in the given order, his score will be
2+1+(2⋅6)+1+(2⋅1)+(2⋅4)=26.
Find the maximum possible score he can obtain after
N rounds.
