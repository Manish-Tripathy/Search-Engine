Min-Max Product Partition
Consider an integer sequence
B of length
M. We define a few terms.
A two-partition of
B is an ordered pair of non-empty sets
(S,T) satisfying the following conditions:
S∪T={1,2,3,…,M}
S∩T=∅
The score of a two-partition
P=(S,T) is defined as
score(P):=min
i∈S
(B
i
)×max
j∈T
(B
j
).
That is, the score of a two-partition is the product of the smallest element among the indices of
S, and the largest element among the indices of
T.
Finally, define
f(B) to be the sum of scores of all two-partitions of
B.
You are given an array
A of length
N.
Your task is to process the following
Q updates to it:
Given
x and
v, set
A
x
to
v.
Output
f(A) initially and also after each update.
Since the values of
f(A) can be large, compute them modulo
998244353.
†
†
A sequence
b is a subsequence of an array
a if
b can be obtained from
a by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q — the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the initial values of the array.
The next
Q lines describe the updates. The
i-th of these lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
v
i
, the parameters for the
i-th update.

Q+1 integers: the value of
f(A) initially and after each update.

Explanation:
Test case
1: These are all the possible partitions and their scores before the first query:
S={1},
T={2,3},
score=2
S={1,2},
T={3},
score=1
S={1,3},
T={2},
score=2
S={2,3},
T={1},
score=1
S={2},
T={1,3},
score=2
S={3},
T={1,2},
score=2
So,
f(A)=10, before the first query.
