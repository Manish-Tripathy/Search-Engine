Balance Difficulties
Suppose a contest has
N problems, with difficulties
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
, and we have a parameter
X. The contest is said to be balanced if and only if the following conditions hold :
A
i
≥A
i−1
for all
2≤i≤N, i.e. the problems are sorted in difficulty order.
A
i
−A
i−1
≤X for all
2≤i≤N, i.e. the difficulties between
2 adjacent problems differ by at most
X.
Right now, your contest has problems of difficulties
B
1
,B
2
,...,B
N
. You sorted them in difficulty order, so
B
i
≥B
i−1
holds.
You want to modify the problems to ensure that the contest becomes balanced. Suppose the final contest difficulties were
C
1
,C
2
,...,C
N
. Then, the cost of this contest is
max
i=1
N
(∣C
i
−B
i
∣). Minimize the cost while achieving a balanced contest. It can be proven that a balanaced contest always exists. Please note that problems are even allowed to have negative difficulties.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N and
X - the size of the array and the parameter.
The second line contains
N integers -
B
1
,B
2
,...,B
N
Output Format
For each test case,
output on a new line :
K the minimum cost of a balanced contest
output on the next line :
N integers,
C

,C

representing a balanced contest acheiveing the minimum cost
K. The following conditions should hold for
C :

Explanation:
Test Case 1 :
C=[6,8,10] are valid contest difficulties because
C

,
C

=2≤K and
C

=2≤K.
Further, the cost of this array is
1 as the maximum value of
∣C
i
−B
i
∣ is
1.
Test case 3 : The array represents an already valid contest.
