Replace With First
You are given two strings,
S and
T, of lengths
N and
M respectively.
You can perform the following operation on any of the strings:
Replace a substring with its first character. (i.e. “abcabc” -> “abcc”)
What is the minimum number of operations to make both of the strings equal? Or determine that it is impossible to make both of the strings equal.
Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase consists of two space-separated integers
N and
M denoting the lengths of the strings
S and
T, respectively.
The second line of each testcase contains the string
S of length
N.
The third line of each testcase contains the string
T of length
M.
Output Format
For each testcase, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the minimum number of operations to make the strings equal, or
−1 if it is not possible to do so.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
You can make
S equal to
T using one operation on
S: "aabc" -> "aab"
Test case
2:
It can be proven that you need at least two operations to make the strings equal. One possible way is as follows:
Perform an operation on
S: "accepted" -> "accpted"
Perform an operation on
T: "accapted" -> "accpted"
Test case
3:
Both strings are already equal.
