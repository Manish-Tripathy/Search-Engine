Asymmetric Cookies
Alice and Bob have
N jars of cookies with them. The
i-th jar has
A
i
(
1≤A
i
≤3) cookies.
They'll take turns eating the cookies, with Alice going first.
However, they eat cookies in different ways.
On her turn, Alice will choose any jar that contains at least one cookie, and eat one cookie from it.
On his turn, Bob will choose any jar that contains at least one cookie, and:
If the jar contains three cookies, he'll eat two of them.
Otherwise, he'll eat only one.
Whoever eats the last cookie is considered the winner.
Alice and Bob are both aiming to win, and will play optimally to achieve this.
Alice has
N possible first moves, each corresponding to choosing a different jar.
How many of them are winning?
That is, how many of Alice's first moves result in a state where Bob has no winning strategy?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of cookie jars.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

– the number of cookies in each jar.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer: the number of winning first moves of Alice.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Initially,
A=[1,2]. Alice has two possible first moves, and they both win:
If Alice chooses the first jar, the counts become
[0,2].
Bob is forced to choose the second jar to make the counts
[0,1], and then Alice can take the last cookie and win.
If Alice chooses the second jar, the counts become
[1,1].
Whichever jar Bob chooses, Alice can then choose the other one and win.
Test case
2: It can be shown that no matter what Alice does, she cannot win. So, there are
0 winning starting moves.
Test case
3: Alice has three possible starting moves. However, only one of them is winning.
If Alice chooses the first jar, Bob can then choose the second jar resulting in
[0,1,1] which Alice cannot win.
If Alice chooses the second jar, resulting in
[1,2,1], Bob cannot win no matter what.
If Alice chooses the third jar, Bob can again choose the second jar resulting in
[1,1,0] which Alice cannot win.
