Cool Subsequences
You are given an array
A containing
N positive integers.
A subsequence of this array is called cool if the averages of all non-empty subsequences of this subsequence are present in the complement subsequence. The complement subsequence refers to the subsequence formed by the elements we didn't consider.
For example, consider the array
A=[8,4,2,1,3,2,5,8,2].
Consider the subsequence
[2,2,8] of this array.
The complement subsequence is
[8,4,1,3,5,2].
The non-empty subsequences of
[2,2,8] are
[2],[8],[2,2],[2,8],[2,2,8], with averages
2,8,2,5,4 respectively.
All of these values are present in the complement subsequence, therefore
[2,2,8] is a cool subsequence.
Note that no rounding is done when computing the average. For example the average of
{1,2,5} is
3
1+2+5
=
3
8
, we do not round it to
2 or
3.
Find any cool subsequence of the array with length at least
1, or report that no such subsequence exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the length of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
— the elements of the array.
Output Format
For each test case,
If a cool subsequence exists in
A, print two lines.
The first line should contain an integer
K (
1≤K<N), denoting the length of the cool subsequence you found.
The second line should contain
K space-separated integers denoting the elements of the cool subsequence.
If no cool subsequence exists, print the single integer
−1 on a new line instead.
If there are multiple cool subsequences in
A, any of them will be accepted as a valid output.
