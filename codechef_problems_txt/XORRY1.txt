Xorry 1
You are given an integer
X. Two integers (
A,
B) are said to be an Xorry pair, if the following conditions are satisfied:
A⊕B=X
0≤A≤B≤X
Among all the pairs which satisfy the above two conditions,
(B−A) is as small as possible
For example, suppose
X=6.
Then, the pair
(0,6) satisfies the first two conditions. But, the pair
(2,4) also satisfies the first two conditions. And since,
(6−0) is larger than
(4−2), the pair
(0,6) does not have the smallest possible difference, and so, it is not an Xorry pair.
You can verify that the pairs
(2,4) and
(3,5) are the only two Xorry pairs for
X=6. This is explained further in the sample explanation below.
Output any one Xorry pair for a given X.
Note that
⊕ refers to bitwise XOR.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line which contains a single integer,
X.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, two space separated integers,
A and
B, where
(A,B) is an Xorry pair, for that particular
X.
If there are multiple Xorry pairs, output any one of them.

Explanation:
Test case 1:
X=1. The only pair of integers which satisfies the first two conditions is
A=0, and
B=1.
This satisfies the first two conditions, since
0⊕1=1, and
0≤1≤1.
Since there is only one pair which satisfies the first two conditions, this is also the pair with the smallest
(B−A), and hence is the only Xorry pair.
So, the only answer for this testcase is
(0,1).
Test case 2:
X=2=(10)
2
. The only pair of integers which satisfies the first two conditions
A=0, and
B=2.
This satisfies the first two conditions, since
(00)
2
⊕(10)
2
=(10)
2
=2, and
0≤2≤2.
Since there is only one pair which satisfies the first two conditions, this is also the pair with the smallest
(B−A), and hence is the only Xorry pair.
So, the only answer for this testcase is
(0,2).
Note that
(10)
2
refers to the binary representation of
2.
Test case 3:
X=3=(11)
2
. There are two pairs which satisfy the first two conditions:
A=0, and
B=3
A=1, and
B=2
(1,2) satisfies both the conditions, since
(01)
2
⊕(10)
2
=(11)
2
=3, and
1≤2≤3.
Among these two pairs,
(B−A) is smallest only in the second pair. Hence the only Xorry pair is
A=1, and
B=2.
So, the only answer for this testcase is
(1,2).
Test case 4:
X=4=(100)
2
. The only pair of integers which satisfies the first two conditions is
A=0, and
B=4.
This satisfies the first two conditions, since
(000)
2
⊕(100)
2
=(100)
2
=4, and
0≤4≤4.
Since there is only one pair which satisfies the first two conditions, this is also the pair with the smallest
(B−A), and hence is the only Xorry pair.
So, the only answer for this testcase is
(0,4).
Test case 5:
X=6=(110)
2
. There are three pairs which satisfy the first two conditions:
A=0, and
B=6
A=2, and
B=4
A=3, and
B=5
(3,5) satisfies both the conditions, since
(011)
2
⊕(101)
2
=(110)
2
=6, and
3≤5≤6.
But among these three pairs,
(B−A) is smallest only in the last two pairs, which have
(B−A) as
2, whereas the first pair has
(B−A) as
6. Hence the only Xorry pairs are
A=2, and
B=4, and
A=3, and
B=5.
So, the two possible answers for this testcase are
(2,4), or
(3,5). You need to output any one of these two pairs.
