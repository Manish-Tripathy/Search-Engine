Assignment Score
Chef has a total of
N+1 assignments. He knows his score on the first
N of them, and he is now working on his last assignment. His scores in the first
N assignment are
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
. Each of them are graded out of
100 marks, and his total marks is just a sum of all his
N+1 assignment marks.
Chef is now worried about he might fail in his course. He will fail if he scores less than
50% of the total marks. Can you help Chef find what is the minimum score he needs to get to not fail? It may be impossible for Chef to pass, output
−1 then.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line contains
N - the number of completed assignments
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,....,A
N
- the scores on those assignments
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line
The minimum score needed on the
N+1'th assignment for Chef to pass, if it possible for him to pass
−1 if it is impossible for Chef to pass

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Chef needs atleast
50%, i.e.
0.5∗200=100 marks to pass. He has
67 marks, hence he needs
33 marks more.
Test Case 3 : Even if Chef gets
100, he will only have
25% marks. Hence, it is impossible for Chef to pass.
