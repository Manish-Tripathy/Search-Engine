Meximal Sum
You are given an integer array
A containing
N elements.
A pair
(L,R),
(1≤L<R<N) is called good pair if:
MEX
(A[1,⋯L])
= MEX
(A[L+1⋯R])
= MEX
(A[R+1⋯N])
where MEX of an array denotes the minimal non-negative integer which is not present in that array.
Now Your task is to find both minimum and maximum value of SUM
(A[1⋯L])
− SUM
(A[L+1⋯R])
+ SUM
(A[R+1⋯N]) for any good pair
and
.
SUM
A([X,Y]) denotes
A
X
+A
X+1
+...+A
Y
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, print the minimum and maximum value of the expression : SUM
(A[1⋯L])
− SUM
(A[L+1⋯R])
+ SUM
(A[R+1⋯N]) for any good pair
L and
R.
If no good pair exists, print
−1−1.

Explanation:
Test case 1 : There is only one good pair
L=1,R=2, and MEX of the
3 parts of the array are all
0. For this pair, the value is
2−4+3=1. This is both the minimum and maximum.
Test Case 2 : It can be proven that there is no good pair in this case.
