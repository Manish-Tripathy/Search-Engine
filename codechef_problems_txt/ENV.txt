Encrypt Value
You are given an array
A containing
N integers.
Consider the following process:
Let
S=0 initially.
For each
i from
1 to
N in order, update
S to either
(S+A
i
) or
(S×A
i
).
That is, either add
A
i
to
S or multiply
S by
A
i
.
Before performing the process, you're allowed to freely rearrange the elements of
A as you like.
If you choose the rearrangement of
A and the sequence of operations optimally, what's the maximum possible value of
S that you can obtain?
This maximum value can be very large, so print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
- the elements of the array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible value of
S, modulo
10
9
+7.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose the rearrangement
A=[2,2,5,4]. Then,
Add
A
1
=2 to
S. Now,
S=2.
Add
A
2
=2 to
S. Now,
S=4.
Multiply
S by
A
3
=5. Now,
S=20.
Multiply
S by
A
4
=4. Now,
S=80.
This is the maximum value that can be obtained.
Test case
2: Choose any rearrangement and sum up all the numbers to get
1+1+2=4.
This is the maximum value that can be obtained.
