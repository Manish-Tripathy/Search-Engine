Stamps 100
You are given a binary string
S of length
N.
You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
Select an integer
i (1≤i≤N−2) and replace the substring
S
i
S
i+1
S
i+2
with 100.
Find the lexicographically smallest string after the operations.
Note: String
X is lexicographically smaller than string
Y if
X
i
<Y
i
, where
i is the first index where
X and
Y differ.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of string
S.
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest string after the operations.

∣S∣=N
Each character of
S is either 0 or 1.
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
3⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: You can convert
S into 100. Since 100 is lexicographically smaller than 110, output 100.
Test case
2: You should keep
S as it is without applying any operations, so output 0001.
