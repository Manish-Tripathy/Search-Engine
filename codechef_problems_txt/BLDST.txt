Ball Distribution
Chef has
N empty boxes. There are
M different colours numbered from
1 to
M such that Chef has
A
i
balls of the
i
th
colour.
A distribution of these balls into boxes is said to be valid if:
Each ball is placed in a box;
All the balls in a box are of different colour.
Over all valid distributions, find the minimum number of boxes having
M balls.
Under the given constraints, it is guaranteed that at least one valid distribution always exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of empty boxes and the number of colours, respectively.
The next line contains
M space-separated integers,
i
th
of which denotes
A
i
i.e. the number of balls of colour
i.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of boxes with
M balls in a valid distribution.

Explanation:
There are
5 boxes and
3 different colours. A possible valid distribution such that number of boxes with
M balls is minimum is:
Box
1 contains balls of colour
1,2,3.
Box
2 contains balls of colour
1,2,3.
Box
3 contains balls of colour
1,2,3.
Box
4 contains balls of colour
1,3.
Box
5 contains balls of colour
1,2.
We can see that boxes
1,2,3 contain
M balls, hence answer is
3.

Explanation:
There are
2 boxes and
2 different colours. A possible valid distribution such that number of boxes with
M balls is minimum is:
Box
1 contains ball of colour
1.
Box
2 contains ball of colour
2.
We can see that no boxes contain
M balls, hence answer is
0.
