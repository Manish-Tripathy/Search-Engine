Tree Colouring (Hard)
This is worth
100 points in Division
1 and
50 points in Divisions
2,
3 and
4.
You have a tree with
N nodes numbered
1 to
N.
You want to assign each node a colour
C
i
(
1≤C
i
≤N) such that the following conditions hold:
Each colour
X appears either
0 times or
≥2 times.
Consider all possible pairs
(A,B) such that
1≤A<B≤N and
C
A
=C
B
:
Each edge should lie on the unique shortest path of one such pair.
Let us call a tree good if it is possible to assign colours satisfying the above property.
We start with a tree of
1 node only, namely
1.
Then for each
i=2...N, do the following:
add the node
i to the tree, by making an edge between
i and
P
i
.
output whether the current tree is good or not.
Further, if the final tree after adding all
N nodes is good, we require you to output an appropriate colour scheme for that tree.
If there are multiple valid colour schemes, you should minimize the number of distinct colours used. If there are still multiple valid schemes, all will be accepted.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line contains
N - the number of nodes in the tree.
The second line contains
N−1 integers -
P

,P

,...,P
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the following:
on the first line, output a binary string
S of length
N−1; where
S
i
=1 if and only if the tree formed by the first
(i+1) nodes is good, otherwise
S
i
=0.
If
S
N−1
=1, then output a second line containing
N integers,

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The tree with
2 nodes and
(1,2) being the only edge is good, as depicted by the colouring
C=[2,2]. There is only one edge and one pair, and the edge lies on the shortest path of that pair.
Test Case 2 : It can be shown that the whole tree of
4 nodes is not good. For example,
C=[1,2,1,2] makes the edge
(2,3) occur on the shortest paths of
2 different pairs.
Test Case 3 : The whole tree of
4 nodes is good as shown by the colouring
C=[1,3,1,3].
