Grid Construction (Odd)
This is the odd version of the Grid Construction Problem. Both are worth 50 points each.
You are given an odd integer
N.
Now your task is to construct a grid
A containing
N rows and
N columns such that :
For every
i,j(1≤i,j≤N)
1≤A
i,j
≤N have to be satisfied.
For every
x(1≤x≤N),
x appears exactly
N times in
A.
Let
S
1
be the sum of elements in the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right and
S
2
be the sum of elements in the diagonal from top-right to bottom-left, Then :
Sum of all elements in every
2 adjacent rows has to be equal to
S
1
+S
2
.
Sum of all elements in every
2 adjacent columns has to be equal to
S
1
+S
2
.
It can be proven that at least one valid answer exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first and only line of input contains
N - the dimension of the grid.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N lines each containing
N integers. The
j-th integer in the
i-th line should represent
A
i,j
of the grid you constructed.
Constraints
1≤T≤30
2≤N≤500
N is odd.
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
500.

1 3 2
3 2 1
2 1 3
Explanation:
Test Case 1 : Here,
S
1
=6,S
2
=6, and each row, column adds to
6, implying adjacent row, column adds to
12=S
1
+S
2
. Thus, it is valid.
