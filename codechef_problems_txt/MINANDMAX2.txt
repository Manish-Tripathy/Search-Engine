Minimum And Maximum II
This problem is worth 50 points.
Let
A denote a permutation of length
N.
Define
f(A)=∑
i=1
N
max(A
i
,A
i+1
), where
A
N+1
=A
1
.
Find the minimum value of
f(A) over all permutations of length
N.
Note that a permutation of length
N consists of all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input containing
N, the size of the permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum value of
f(A).
Note : The answer may not fit in a 32-bit integer. You are recommended to use 64-bit integers.

)=max(1,3)+max(3,2)+max(2,1)=3+3+2=8. It can be proven it's impossible to get a permutation with a smaller
f(A).
Test case
2 : The optimal permutation is
A=[2,4,3,1], with
f(A)=13.
