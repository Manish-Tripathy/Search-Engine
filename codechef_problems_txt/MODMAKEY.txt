Mod and Make Y
Given
2 parameters
X and
Y and an array
B of length
M, define
f(B,X)=(((XmodB
1
)modB
2
)…modB
M
).
The array
B is called good if it is possible to rearrange
B in some way such that
f(B,X)=Y.
You are given an array
A of length
N, and
2 parameters
X and
Y.
Find all
K such that the prefix of array
A with length
K is good, i.e.
[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
K
] is good. Print these values of
K in increasing order.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N,
X and
Y.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output the following:
on the first line, output the number of prefixes that are good, say
L.
on the second line, output
L integers,
K
1
,
K
2
,…,K
L
- where each
K
i
is distinct and is the length of a good prefix. Further, the elements must be printed in ascending order, i.e.
K
i
<K
i+1
.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤400
1≤A
i
,X≤5⋅10
4
0≤Y≤X
The sum of
N over all test cases does not exceed
400.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 :
K=4 is good because we can rearrange
B=[A
1
,A
2
,A
3
,A
4
]=[3,12,5,4] to
[12,4,5,3]. We can verify
((((10mod12)mod4)mod5)mod3)=2.
Test Case 2 : There are no good prefixes.
