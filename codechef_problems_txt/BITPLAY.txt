Bit Play
Chefina has a binary string
S of odd length
N.
She also has an operation string
o of length
2
(N−1)
where
o
i
∈{&,∣,⊕}. Note that
&,∣,⊕ denote the bitwise and, or, and xor operations respectively.
The following conditions are satisfied with respect to the strings:

Help Chef find the number of operation strings
o which satisfy the conditions. Since the number can be huge, print it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an odd integer
N — the length of the string.
The next line consists of a binary string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the number of operation strings
o which satisfy the conditions, modulo
10
9
+7.
