Equal Pairs (Easy)
This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, the array
A is fixed from the start. The constraint on
N is also smaller:
N≤100.
For an array
A containing non-negative integers, we define
f(A) as follows:
First, for each index
i such that
A
i
=0, replace
A
i
by an arbitrary positive integer of your choice.
Then, calculate the number of pairs
(i,j) such that
i<j and
A
i
=A
j
.
That is, the number of pairs of distinct indices that contain the same value.
Let this value be
P.
f(A) is then the maximum possible value of
P if you choose the replacements of the zeros appropriately.
You are given an array
A, where some elements are
0 and the others are positive. Find
f(A).
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the size of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the value of
f(A).

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are no
0-s to replace. The array
A given is fixed, and we need to compute the number of equal pairs.
(1,3) and
(4,5) are the
2 pairs of indices with equal values.
Test case
2: We can replace both the
0-s with
1-s to get
A=[1,1,2,1,1]. This has
6 equal pairs.
