Perfect Prefixes
A permutation of length
N is an array of length
N that contains every integer from
1 to
N exactly once.
For example,
[1,3,2] and
[2,1,3] are permutations of length
3, but
[2,1,2] and
[3,4,2] are not.
The beauty of a permutation
P is defined to be the number of prefixes of
P that are themselves permutations.
That is, it is the number of integers
i (
1≤i≤N) such that the array
[P
1
,P
2
,…,P
i
] is a permutation of length
i.
You are given a permutation
P of length
N.
You can perform the following operation on it at most once:
Choose two integers
L and
R such that
1≤L<R≤N, and
L and
R have different parities.
That is, if
L is odd then
R should be even, and vice versa.
Then, for each
i=L,L+2,L+4,…,R−1, swap
P
i
with
P
i+1
.
In simpler words, you can choose a subarray of
P that has even length, partition it into blocks of length
2, and swap the elements within each block.
For example, if
P=[3,1,5,2,6,4] and you choose
L=2 and
R=5, the resulting permutation is
P=[3,5,1,6,2,4].
Find the maximum possible beauty of
P after performing at most one such operation.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the length of the permutation.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
P
1
,P
2
,…,P
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible beauty of
P after performing at most one operation.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Perform the operation with
L=1,R=4 to obtain
[1,3,2,4,5].
The prefixes of length
1,3,4,5 are permutations now, which is the best we can do.
Test case
2: Perform the operation with
L=5,R=6 to obtain
[2,1,3,4,5,6] which has every prefix except length
1 be a permutation.
Test case
3: It's optimal to not perform any operation, every prefix is already a permutation.
