Nice Array
You're given an array
A of length
N, and an integer
K.
A is said to be a nice array if there exists an array
B of length
N satisfying the following conditions:
For every index
i (
1≤i≤N),
B
i
=⌊
K
A
i
⌋, or
B
i
=⌈
K
A
i
⌉; and
B
1
+B
2
+…+B
N
=0.
Is
A a nice array?
Note that
⌊  ⌋ and
⌈  ⌉ denote the floor and ceiling functions, respectively.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — the length of array
A and the division parameter.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the elements of the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single string denoting the answer: "YES" if
A is a nice array, and "NO" otherwise (without quotes).
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e., the strings NO, No, nO, and no will all be treated as equivalent.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose
B=[1,2,−1,2], which satisfies
B
i
=⌊
K
A
i
⌋ for all
i. The sum of this array is
0, so
A is nice.
Test case
3: No valid
B exists, so
A isn't nice.
Test case
4:
B=[−1,1] is a valid array, so
A is nice.
