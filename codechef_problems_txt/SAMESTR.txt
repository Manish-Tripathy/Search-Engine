Convert string
You are given a binary string
S of length
N.
For a positive integer
k, you can perform the following operation on string
S:
Choose
k elements from the string
S;
Perform a total of
k flips on the chosen
k elements. A flip changes a 0 to 1 and vice versa. Note that you can use multiple flips on the same element.
Find the count of all such
k in range
[1,N], such that, you can apply the operation optimally, and make all characters of the string equal.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
N — the length of the string
S.
The next line contains a binary string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the count of all such
k in range
[1,N], such that you can apply the operation optimally and make all characters of the string equal.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Given
S=111, let us consider all values of
k in range
[1,3]:
k=1: It is impossible to make all characters of the string same after applying a flip.
k=2: Choose
S
1
,S
3
, and perform two flips on
S
1
to obtain
S=111.
k=3: Choose
S
1
,S
2
,S
3
and perform one flip each to obtain the string
S=000.
Thus, we can make all characters of the string same, using
k=2 and
k=3.
Test case
2: Given
S=1001, let us consider all values of
k in range
[1,4]:
k=1: It is impossible to make all characters of the string same.
k=2: Choose
S
2
,S
3
, and perform one flip each on both to obtain
S=1111.
k=3: It is impossible to make all characters of the string same.
k=4: Choose
S
1
,S
2
,S
3
,S
4
, and perform three flips on
S
2
and one flip on
S
3
to obtain
S=1111.
Thus, we can make all characters of the string same, with
k=2 and
k=4.
