ABC Conjecture 3
You are given a string
S of length
N, containing only the characters a, b, and c.
In one move, you can modify
S as follows:
Choose three indices
i,j,k (
1≤i<j<k≤∣S∣) such that
S
i
=a,S
j
=b,S
k
=c.
That is, choose some subsequence of
S that equals abc.
Then, delete either the a or the c from
S, that is, either index
i or index
k.
Note that this reduces the length of
S by
1.
For example, if
S=cbb
a
c
b
a
c
c, you can choose
i=4,j=6,k=8 (the underlined indices), and then delete either index
4 (obtaining
S=cbbcbacc) or index
8 (obtaining
S=cbbacbac).
Find the minimum number of moves that can be made on
S, such that it's impossible to perform any further moves on the resulting string.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the length of
S.
The second line of each test case contains the string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line minimum possible number of moves that can be made on
S, such that it's not possible to perform any further moves.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Choose
i=1,j=2,k=3 and delete index
1. Now,
S=bcc and no more moves can be performed.
Test case
2: No moves can be performed for the given string, so the answer is
0.
Test case
3: One optimal solution is as follows:
Choose
i=2,j=6,k=7, and delete index
7.
Now,
S=aabacb.
Choose
i=2,j=3,k=5, and delete index
5.
Now,
S=aabab, and no more moves can be performed.
It can be shown that using less than
2 moves is not possible.
