Shortest Distances 101
You are given a directed graph with
N nodes numbered
1 to
N, and an array
A of size
N.
The graph is such that there is an edge directed from node
i to node
(i+j) for all
1≤j≤A
i
. No other edges are present in the graph.
Handle
Q queries of the form:
Given nodes
X and
Y, find the minimum number of edges on a path from node
X to node
Y. If it is impossible to go from
X to
Y, output
−1 instead.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N and
Q - the number of nodes in the graph, and the number of queries respectively.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1

2
,…,A
N
- the array describing the graph's structure.
Each of the next
Q lines contain
2 integers,
X and
Y - a query asking for the minimum number of edges in a path from
X to
Y.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line, the minimum number of edges in a path from
X to
Y or
−1 if it is impossible to reach
X from
Y.

Explanation:
Test case
2 : The graph is depicted in the picture :
Query
1 : We can take the directed path from
1 to
2 and then
2 to
5 for a length of
2. There exists no shorter path, hence the distance between
1 and
5 is
2.
Query
2 :
2 and
4 are connected with a directed edge from
2 to
4, hence we can simply use that for a distance of
1.
Query
4 : There doesn't exist any path from
3 to
4.
