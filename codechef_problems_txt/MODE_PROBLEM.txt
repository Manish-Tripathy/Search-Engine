Breezy Mode Problem
For an array
B, let
f(B)= the number of occurrences of the mode
†
†
in
B.
For example,
f([2])=1,f([2,3,3])=2,f([3,3,3,4,4,4])=3.
You’re given an array
A of length
N and
Q queries of the following type:
P
X: Given integers
P and
X,
Set
A
P
=X;
Find the minimum value of
i=1
∑
N
f([A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
]) for any rearrangement of updated
A.
Please note that the queries are interdependent, meaning the element updation made during one query will be reflected in subsequent queries.

Mode of an array is the element with maximum frequency. If multiple elements have maximum frequency, all of them are said to be modes. For example, array
[3,3,3,4,4,4] has mode
3 and
4, as both have frequency
3.
Input Format
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
Q - the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
, denoting the array.
The next
Q lines, each contain two space-separated integers
P and
X, denoting the query.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line, the answer to the query.

Explanation:
Query
1: Initially,
A=[2,2,1]:
Set
A
3
=2, so
A becomes
[2,2,2];
No matter how we rearrange it, the answer remains
f([2])+f([2,2])+f([2,2,2])=1+2+3=6.
Query
2: Initially,
A=[2,2,2]:
Set
A
3
=1, so
A becomes
[2,2,1];
We can rearrange
A to
[2,1,2] to obtain the value
f([2])+f([2,1])+f([2,1,2])=1+1+2=4.
Query
3: Initially,
A=[2,2,1]:
Set
A
1
=3, so
A becomes
[3,2,1];
No matter how we rearrange it, the answer remains
