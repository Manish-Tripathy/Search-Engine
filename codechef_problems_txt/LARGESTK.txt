Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider the subsequence
[2,1] consisting of
2 distinct elements. The length of subsequence is
2 which is divisible by the number of distinct elements.
Test case
2: Consider the subsequence
[2,1,3] consisting of
3 distinct elements. The length of subsequence is
3 which is divisible by the number of distinct elements.
