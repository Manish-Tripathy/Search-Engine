Arya In Grid
Arya the monkey is trapped inside an
N×M grid!
The grid has
N rows (numbered
1 to
N from top to bottom) and
M columns (numbered
1 to
M from left to right). The cell at the intersection of row
i and column
j is denoted
(i,j).
Arya wants to escape the grid, of course - but first, he needs information.
Arya is initially at cell
(X
0
,Y
0
) of the grid, and can move to other cells by jumping to them. Arya's jump strength is
L, meaning Arya can jump exactly
L units in any of the four directions up, down, left, and right.
Formally, from cell
(a,b), Arya can jump to the following cells:
(a−L,b),(a+L,b),(a,b−L),(a,b+L) (provided the destination is within the grid).
How many distinct cells in the grid can Arya reach using zero or more jumps of this form?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case will contain five space-separated integers
N,M,X
0
,Y
0
, and
L — the dimensions of the grid, Arya's starting position, and Arya's jump strength.
Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing the answer: the number of distinct cells Arya can reach within the grid.

Explanation:
Test case
1: There's only one cell in the grid.
Test case
2: The grid is of dimensions
3×4, and Arya starts at
(2,3) with
L=2.
Arya can jump to
(2,1), and that's the only other cell that can be visited.
Test case
4: Since
L=1, Arya can reach every cell in the grid.
There are

18
cells in the grid - so this is the answer.
Note that the answer may exceed the limit of a 32-bit integer.
