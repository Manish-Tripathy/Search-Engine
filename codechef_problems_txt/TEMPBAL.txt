Temperature Balance
There are
N chambers of water in a line. Between the
i-th chamber and the
(i+1)-th chamber for each
1≤i<N, there is a wall blocking heat from moving between the two chambers. The water in the
i-th chamber has a temperature level of
A
i
. Additionally, it is known in advance that the sum of
A
i
is
0.
Each second, you lift exactly one wall, letting heat move between two chambers. Then, the temperature level of the hotter side decreases by
1, while that of the colder side increases by
1. Formally:
Each second, you choose an integer
i (
1≤i<N), and lift the wall between the
i-th chamber and the
(i+1)-th chamber. Then, the following happens.
If
A
i
>A
i+1
currently, the two temperature values change to
A
i
:=A
i
−1 and
A
i+1
:=A
i+1
+1 the exact next second.
If
A
i
<A
i+1
currently, the two temperature values change to
A
i
:=A
i
+1 and
A
i+1
:=A
i+1
−1 the exact next second.
If
A
i
=A
i+1
currently, nothing happens for one second.
After this second, the chamber closes.
Please find the minimum number of seconds needed to make all temperature levels exactly
0. It can be shown that it is always possible to make all temperature levels exactly
0 in a finite number of seconds.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : One can make all temperature levels
0 in
3 seconds by the following process.
Second
0: Lift the wall between the
1st chamber and the
2nd chamber. Then
a becomes
[0,1,0,−1] at Second
1.
Second
1: Lift the wall between the
2nd chamber and the
3rd chamber. Then
a becomes
[0,0,1,−1] at Second
2.
Second
2: Lift the wall between the
3rd chamber and the
4th chamber. Then
a becomes
[0,0,0,0] at Second
3.
It can be shown that one cannot make all temperature levels
0 in
2 seconds. Therefore, the minimum answer is
3.
