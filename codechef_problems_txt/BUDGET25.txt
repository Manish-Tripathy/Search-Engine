Budget Allotment
This year's annual budget involved a discussion on
N sectors where the
i
th
sector was initially allocated an amount
A
i
.
It was later realised that a minimum budget of
X is required by each sector.
Allocation can be transferred from sector
i to any sector
j only if the final allocation for sector
i remains at least
X.
Find the maximum number of sectors that can meet the minimum required budget of
X after possible transfers.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X — the number of sectors and the minimum budget requirement of each sector, respectively.
The next line consists of
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…A
N
, denoting the initial budget allocated to each sector.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the maximum number of sectors that can meet the minimum required budget of
X after possible transfers.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The minimum requirement for each sector is
2. Since sector
3 was allocated
3 units initially,
1 unit can be transferred to sector
2, leading to a final allocation of
[2,2,2]. Thus,
3 sectors have the minimum required budget.
Test case
2: The minimum requirement for each sector is
3. Since no sector has surplus budget, no transfers would take place. Thus,
0 sectors have the minimum required budget.
