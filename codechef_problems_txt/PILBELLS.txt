Bells of Pilgrimage
The Child of Prophecy has embarked on a journey to save the land of the Fae.
On her journey, she must ring
N Bells of Pilgrimage.
The Child of Prophecy has an initial mana level of
P. After that:
Each of the first
X bells she rings will increase her mana level by
10.
Each of the remaining bells will increase her mana level by
5.
As a bonus, once the final bell is rung, her mana level will increase by a further
20.
K bells have been rung so far. What is the current mana level of the Child of Prophecy?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing four space-separated integers
N,
X,
K, and
P — as described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line a single integer: the Child of Prophecy's current mana level.

Explanation:
In all sample test cases, the initial mana level is
80, the first two bells provide
+10 to it, and the next
4 provide
+5 to it.
Test case
1: No bells were rung, so the mana level remains at
80.
Test case
2: One bell was rung, so the mana level is
80+10=90
Test case
3: Four bells were rung, so the mana level is
80+10+10+5+5=110
Test case
4: All bells were rung, so the mana level is
80+10+10+5+5+5+5+20=140.
Note that the extra
20 is a bonus for ringing all the bells; the last bell still provides
+5 on its own.
