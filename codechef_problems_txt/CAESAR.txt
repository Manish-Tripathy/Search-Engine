Caesar Cipher
In the ROT-K cipher, each character in the string is shifted a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. The value of K represents the number of positions to shift. For instance, in ROT-2, each character is shifted
2 positions. The ROT-2 cipher of the string code is eqfg.
Note that the rotation is performed in a circular manner, meaning that if the character z is shifted by one position, we obtain the character a.
You are given strings
S,T, and
U, each of length
N, such that the ROT-K cipher of string
S is string
T.
Find the ROT-K cipher of string
U.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
Q, denoting the number of queries.
Each query consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each query contains
N — the length of the strings.
The second line contains the string
S.
The third line contains the string
T.
The fourth line contains the string
U.
Output Format
For each query, output on a new line, the ROT-K cipher of string
U.
Constraints
1≤Q≤100
1≤N≤1000
S,T, and
U contain lowercase english alphabets only.

Explanation:
Query
1: Given
S= abc, and
T= bcd, we can observe that each character has been shifted by
1 position. Thus, the ROT-1 cipher of string cde would be def.
Query
2: Given
S= bd, and
T= zb, we can observe that each character has been shifted by
24 positions. Thus, the ROT-24 cipher of string dd would be bb. Note that since the shift is cyclic, dd becomes zz after
22 shifts and bb after the remaining
2 shifts.
