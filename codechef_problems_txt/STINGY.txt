Stingy Arrays
An array
B is said to be stingy if no two of its adjacent elements are equal.
That is,
B is stingy iff
B

for each
1≤i<∣B∣.
Alice and Bob have an array
A with them, and decided to play a game on it.
They alternate turns, with Alice going first.
On their turn, a player chooses any subsequence
S of
A, such that
S is a maximum length stingy subsequence of
A, and deletes it from
A.
The remaining elements don't change their order.
This game continues as long as
A is not empty, with the winner being the player who makes the last move.
With optimal play, who wins?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a two lines of input.
The first line contains a single integer
N, the length of the array.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1

2
,…,A
N
: the elements of array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the winner: either Alice or Bob.
Each character of the output may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase, i.e, the strings BOB, Bob ,boB, and bob will all be treated as equivalent.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Alice chooses the subsequence
[1,2,3] on her turn and deletes it. The remaining array is
[1], which Bob chooses and ends the game.
Test case
2: Alice can choose the entire array on her turn.
Test case
3: The only stingy subsequence is
[2], so both players must repeatedly choose it. Bob makes the last move and wins.
Test case
4: Alice chooses the stingy subsequence
[2,4,5,4] with indices
(1,3,4,5) and deletes it. The remaining array is
[4,4].
Bob can only choose
[4] now, leaving Alice with the array
[4] which she can clear out and win.
