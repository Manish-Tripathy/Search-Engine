Interval Cliques
We have
N intervals
I
1
,I
2
,...,I
N
where
I
j
=[L
j
,R
j
] meaning it contains all real numbers between
L
j
and
R
j
. It is guaranteed that all
2⋅N endpoints of the intervals are distinct.
Construct a graph of
N nodes such that there is an edge between nodes
X and
Y if and only if the following 2 conditions are both satisfied :
There exists at least one real number contained in
I
X
but not in
I
Y
There exists at least one real number contained in
I
Y
but not in
I
X
Find the maximum size of a clique

Maximum size of a clique refers to the Clique Problem
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the number of intervals.
The next
N lines contain
2 integers each -
L
j
and
R
j
, the left and right endpoints of the interval.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum clique size of the constructed graph

Explanation:
Test case 1 :
The edges present in the graph are
(1,3) and
(2,3) but the edge
(1,2) is not present.
Edge
(1,3) is present because
1.5 is a real number belonging to
I
1
but not
I
3
5.71 is a real number belonging to
I
3
but not
I
1
.
Edge
(1,2) is not present because
There does not exist a real number belonging to
I
2
but not
I
1
.
The maximum clique size in this graph is formed by taking the subset
(1,3) or the subset
(2,3) both of which have size
2.
