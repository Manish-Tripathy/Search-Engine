GCD to 1 (Hard)
This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between this and easy version is that you need to minimize the sum of matrix in this version
Construct a matrix
A of size
N∗M such that the GCD of every row and column is
1 and the sum of elements of matrix is minimized. The element must be
2<=A
i,j
<=10
9
.
If there are multiple answers possible, print any.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of single line of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print a matrix of size
N∗M.

2≤N,M≤3⋅10

The sum of
N⋅M over all test cases won't exceed
3⋅10

Explanation:
In the first test case there are 4 rows and 4 columns
GCD of 1st row = GCD(2,2,3,2) = 1
GCD of 2nd row = GCD(3,2,2,2) = 1
GCD of 3rd row = GCD(2,3,2,2) = 1
GCD of 4th row = GCD(2,2,2,3) = 1
GCD of 1st column = GCD(2,3,2,2) = 1
GCD of 2nd column = GCD(2,2,3,2) = 1
GCD of 3rd column = GCD(3,2,2,2) = 1
GCD of 4th column = GCD(2,2,2,3) = 1
The sum of the matrix is 36. It can be proven that there can not be any other matrix such that the GCD of every row and column is 1 and the sum is less than 36.
