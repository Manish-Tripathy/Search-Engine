Distinct 2 Subarray
An array is called good if it has exactly
2 distinct elements. For example,
[1,1,2,1,2],[5,3] are good but
[1,2,3] and
[1,1,1] are not.
You are given an array
A of
N elements and you should find the length of the shortest possible good subarray
†
†
of
A. If no good subarray exists, print
−1 instead.
†
†
B is said to be an subarray of
A if
B can be formed by deleting a (possibly empty) prefix of
A and a (possibly empty) suffix of
A. For example,
[4,1,3],[3,5] and
[4,1,3,5,2] are subarrays of
[4,1,3,5,2] but
[5,3] and
[1,5] are not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each line contains
N - the length of the array.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the length of the shortest good subarray of
A, or
−1 if none exist.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 :
[5,3] itself is good, and is the shortest possible good subarray of
A.
Test Case 2 : There are no good subarrays because the only subarray contains
1 distinct element only.
