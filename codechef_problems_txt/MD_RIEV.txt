Palindromic Prime Numbers
A palindromic prime number is a positive integer that is both a prime number (meaning it has exactly two divisors:
1 and itself) and a palindrome in base
10 (meaning it reads the same both backwards and forwards).
Leading zeros are not considered when determining if a number is a palindrome (so
20 is not a palindrome, even though it can be written as
020).
You are given an integer
N.
Consider the first
N palindromic prime numbers. How many of them have an even number of digits, and how many of them have an odd number of digits?
Some examples:
2,7, and
11 are palindromic primes.
22 and
121 are palindromes that are not primes.
17 and
37 are primes that are not palindromes.
42 is neither a palindrome nor a prime.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
N — meaning you must consider the first
N palindromic prime numbers.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line two space-separated integers: among the first
N palindromic primes, the number of them that have an even number of digits and the number of them that have an odd number of digits, respectively.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
N=1, so we only consider the first palindromic prime,
2. It has one digit.
Test case
2:
N=4, so we consider the first four palindromic primes
[2,3,5,7].
They all have one digit.
Test case
3: The first
8 palindromic primes are
[2,3,5,7,11,101,131,151].
Of them,
11 has two digits (an even number) and everything else has either one or three digits (which are odd).
