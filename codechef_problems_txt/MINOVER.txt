Overwrite
You are given two arrays
A and
B, of lengths
N and
M respectively (
M≤N).
All the elements of
A are distinct, and all the elements of
B are distinct — that is,
A
i

=A
j
for
i

=j, and
B
i

=B
j
for
i

=j.
In one operation, you can do the following:
Choose a subarray
†
†
of
A with length
M, and replace it with a cyclic rotation
‡
‡
of the array
B.
For instance, if
A=[3,2,5,4,6] and
B=[2,1,3], you can choose to replace the subarray
[2,5,4] of
A with the array
[3,2,1] which is a cyclic shift of
B, to obtain
[3,3,2,1,6].
Your task is to find the lexicographically minimum possible array
A that can be obtained by performing this operation several (possibly, zero) times.
An array
P of length
N is lexicographically smaller than another array
Q of the same length if and only if there exists an index
i (
1≤i≤N) such that:
P
i
<Q
i
; and
P
j
=Q
j
for all
1≤j<i
†
†
A subarray of an array is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from its prefix and some (possibly zero) elements from its suffix.
For example, if
A=[1,3,4,2] then
[1],[3,4,2], and
[1,3] are some of its subarrays; whereas
[1,4] is not a subarray of
A.
‡
‡
A cyclic rotation of an array is obtained by repeatedly moving its first element to its end, zero or more times.
For example, the cyclic rotations of
[1,3,4,2] are
[1,3,4,2],[3,4,2,1],[4,2,1,3],[2,1,3,4].
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M — the lengths of the arrays
A and
B, respectively.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
A

The third line contains

B

B.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line
N space-separated integers, denoting the lexicographically minimum array
A that can be obtained by performing the given operation several times.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Perform these two operations:
Replace subarray
[4] of
A with
[2], to obtain
[2,1,6].
Replace subarray
[6] of
A with
[2], to obtain
[2,1,2].
This is the lexicographically smallest array that can be obtained.
Test case
2: It's optimal to not perform any moves.
Test case
3: Perform one operation:
Replace subarray
[3,7,1] of
A with
[3,6,4] (which is a cyclic rotation of
B) to obtain
[2,3,6,4].
This is optimal.
