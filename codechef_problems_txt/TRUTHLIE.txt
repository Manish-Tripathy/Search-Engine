Truth Teller And Liars 101
You are a traveler and you are at a junction of
2 paths - one leads to eternal happiness, the other to certain doom.
There are a total of
N+M people,
N of which always tell the truth, while the remaining
M may tell the truth or lie. All of them are aware of which path leads to where.
You don't know who is a truth teller and who is not. You will ask some randomly chosen
X people the following question :
Which among the
2 paths leads to eternal happiness?
Is it possible for you to be sure which paths leads to eternal happiness?
If it is possible, find the minimal
X where you can be sure of the path regardless of which
X people you end up asking. Otherwise, print
−1.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
M - the number of truth tellers, and the number of people who may or may not tell the truth.
Output Format
For each test case, output the following :
−1 if there is no way to figure out which path is the path to happiness.
Otherwise, print an integer
X (1≤X≤N+M), where
X is the minimum integer such that you can be sure of the path after asking any
X people.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N,M≤10

Explanation:
Test case
1 : It can be proven that asking
2 people is not sufficient as one of them could be the liar and give a different answer than the truth teller, and you can't know who is lying and who is not.
With all
3 responses, it is possible to figure out the correct path. For example, suppose the responses were Path
1, Path
1 and Path
2. Then you know that the correct path is Path
1.
Test case
2 : It can be proven to be impossible to figure out the correct path.
