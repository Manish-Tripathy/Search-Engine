Glass Bridge (Easy)
This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between this version and the hard version are the constraints on
N and
M
Chef is watching the new season of Squid Game, where contestants face a glass bridge challenge.
The bridge has
M steps, and each step consists of two glass panels suspended side by side.
Exactly one panel on each step is strong enough to support a contestant's weight, while the other panel will shatter, causing the contestant to fall and die.
There are
N contestants who cross the bridge one by one, in sequence. Each contestant can observe the path taken by the previous contestant(s).
For each step
i (1≤i≤M), determine the probability that all
N contestants die before crossing step
i.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input comprising of two space-separated integers
N and
M denoting the number of contestants and the number of steps respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print
M space-separated integers where
i
th
integer is probability of all
N contestants dying before crossing step
i.
The probability can be written in the form of
Q
P
such that
Q is not divisible by

Constraints
1≤T,N,M≤2⋅10

The sum of
N and the sum of
M over all test cases won't exceed

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The answers are
1/2,
3/4.
The probability of the contestants crossing
1
st
step is
1/2 and the probability of them crossing both steps is
1/4, hence the probability of them dying before crossing
1
st
and
2
nd
steps are
(1−1/2) and
(1−1/4) respectively.
Test Case 2 : The answer is
1/2
Test Case 3 : The answers are
0,
1/4,
1/2
