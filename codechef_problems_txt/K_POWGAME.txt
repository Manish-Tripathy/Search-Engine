Shivansh and Tina are playing a game. The players move in alternating turns with Shivansh starting first.
They have integers
N and
K. In one move, a player has to:
Choose any non-negative integer
X such that
K
X
≤N;
Subtract
K
from
N.
The player who cannot make a move loses. If both players play optimally, find the winner of the game.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
K — as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line Shivansh if Shivansh wins the game, otherwise Tina.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings Tina, TINA, tina, and TiNa will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1:
Shivansh chooses
X=1 and subtracts
2
1
from
2 to get
0.
Since Tina cannot make a move now, Shivansh wins.
Test case
2:
Shivansh chooses
X=1 and subtracts
3
1
from
4 to get
1.
Tina chooses
X=0 and subtracts
3
0
from
1 to get
0.
Since Shivansh cannot make a move now, Tina wins.
Test case
3: Shivansh cannot reduce the number further, it is already
0, so he loses.
