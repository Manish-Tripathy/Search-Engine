ALIEN-OR
You are given:
positive integers
N and
K
(K≤N).
an array
A of size
N, where each element of the array is a binary string of length
K;
For each
1≤j<2
K
, your task is to find whether there exists a set of indices
{i
1
,i
2
,…,i
m
}
(1≤i
j
,m≤N) such that:
The decimal value of
(A

…
∣
A

) equals
j, where
∣ denotes bitwise OR operation.
Print YES if a set of indices satisfying the given condition exists for all
1≤j<2
K
. Otherwise, print NO.
Input Format
The first line contains an integer
T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
N and
K.
The
i-th of the next
N lines contains the binary string
A
i
.
Output Format
For each test case, print YES if a set of indices satisfying the given condition exists for all
1≤j<2
K
. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1:
j=1 : The set of indices
{1} satisfies the condition as decimal value of
A
1
=1=j.
j=2 : The set of indices
{2} satisfies the condition as decimal value of
A
2
=2=j.
j=3 : The set of indices
{1,2} satisfies the condition as decimal value of
(A
1
∣
A
2
)=3=j.
Test case
2: The set of indices for
j=2,3,4,6,7 are
{2},{3},{4},{2,4}, and
{3,4} respectively.
However, there doesn't exist any set of indices for
j=1 and
j=5. Hence output is NO.
