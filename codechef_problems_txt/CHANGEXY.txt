Change A to B
You are given positive integers
A,B, and
K.
For a variable
x with an initial value
A, you need to achieve the target value
B. In one operation, you can:
Either change
x to
x+1, or
Change
x to
K⋅x.
Find the minimum number of operations needed to go from
x=A to
x=B.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case contains three space-separated integers
A,B,K — the initial and target values of the variable
x and the constant.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations needed to go from
x=A to
x=B.

Explanation:
Test case
1 : We can use the second type of operation thrice to get
A=1→2→4→8=B.
Test case
2 : We can use the first type of operation to get
x=4 and then the second operation to get
x=2⋅4=8=B.
Test case
3 : Second operation and then the first operation yields
3→6→7.
