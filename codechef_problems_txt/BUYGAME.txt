Buying Game
You want to buy
N items from a store, which you will visit on Days
1,
2, ...,
N. The normal cost of the
i-th item is
A
i
.
However, on the
i-th day, there is a promotional event for the
i-th item. On this day, it's cost is
B
i
instead.
B
i
may be greater, smaller or even equal to
A
i
.
Thus, on the
i-th day, the cost of the
i-th item is
B
i
while, the
j-th item
(j

=i) costs
A
j
.
You will buy exactly one item on each of the
N days. All the bought items must be distinct. Find the minimum possible cost.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The following is a possible optimal approach :
Buy Item
2 on Day
1 for cost of
2. (Normal Cost)
Buy Item
1 on Day
2 for cost of
1. (Normal Cost)
Buy Item
