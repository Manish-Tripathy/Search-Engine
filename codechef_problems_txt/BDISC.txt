i-th item has a cost of
A
i
.
You would like to purchase all
N items.
The shop offers a discount: whenever an item is bought, all future purchases have their costs reduced by
1. However, the cost of an item also cannot fall below
0.
You can buy the items in any order you like. What's the minimum possible cost of purchasing all
N items?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We buy the first item with a cost of
4. This then discounts the second item by
1, so we buy it for a cost of
2, with the total coming out to
4+2=6. This is optimal.
Test case
2: All the items have initial costs of
2. The process is as follows:
Buy one item with a cost of
2. This reduces the cost of everything else by
1, so they're all
1 now.
Buy one item with a cost of
1. This reduces the cost of the remaining two items by
1 again, so they both cost
0.
Buy one item with a cost of
0. This reduces the cost of the last item by
1 again. However, since it cannot go below
0, it remains
0.
Buy the last item with a cost of
0.
The total spent is
2+1+0+0=3.
Test case
3: Consider the following order:
Buy the second item, with a cost of
1. The other items' costs will reduce by
1.
Buy the fourth item, with a cost of
1−1=0. The other items' costs will reduce by
1.
Buy the first item, with a cost of
3−2=1. The other items' costs will reduce by
1 again.
Finally, buy the third item with a cost of
4−3=1.
The total spent is
1+0+1+1=3.
