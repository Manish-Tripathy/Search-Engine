Rock-Paper-Scissors
Chef and Chefina are playing the famous game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
The game consists of
N rounds. In each round, both players choose one of the three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, denoted by R, P, and S respectively.
If both players play the same move, the current round ends in a draw and neither of them gets a point.
If one of the players plays Rock and the other plays Scissors, the player who played Rock wins the round and gets a point.
If one of the players plays Scissors and the other plays Paper, the player who played Scissors wins the round and gets a point.
If one of the players plays Paper and the other plays Rock, the player who played Paper wins the round and gets a point.
You are given a string
A of length
N denoting the moves made by Chefina in
N rounds.
To win the game, Chef needs to score more than
⌊
2
N
⌋ points.
Find the lexicographically smallest sequence of moves that wins the game for Chef.
Note:
⌊x⌋ denotes the floor function. For example,
⌊
2
3
⌋=1.
A string
X is said to be lexicographically smaller than string
Y, if, for the first position where
X and
Y differ,
X
i
<Y
i
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integers
N — the length of the string.
The next line contains a string
A of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the lexicographically smallest string of length
N which wins the game for Chef.

Explanation:
Test case
1: To win the game, Chef needs to play paper.
Test case
2: To win the game, Chef needs to win both rounds. Thus he needs to play SR.
Test case
3: To win the game, Chef needs to win at least two rounds. Some possible sequence of moves that win the game for Chef are:
{ PRP, PSS, PPS, PRR, PRS, RRS
}.
