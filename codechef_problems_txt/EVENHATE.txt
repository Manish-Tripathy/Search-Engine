Even Numbers Hate
Sushil has an array
A of
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
. He constructs a new array from it, the prefix sum array
P=[P
1
,P
2
,...,P
N
], where
P
i
=A
1
+A
2
+...+A
i
, i.e. the sum of the first
i elements.
Sushil hates even numbers but he likes odd numbers, and thus wants to sure there are as many odd numbers as possible in the prefix sum array
P. He is allowed to play with the array
A and rearrange it arbitrarily. Find the maximum number of odd numbers in the prefix sum array
P if Sushil rearranges the array
A optimally.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the size of the array
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,...,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible number of odd numbers in the prefix sum array.
Constraints
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤100
1≤A

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The optimal rearrangement is
[1,4,2,3]. The constructed prefix sum array is as follows :
P
1
=A
1
=1
P
2
=A
1
+A
2
=5

=7
P

=A

+A

=10
It has only
1 even number and
3 odd numbers. It can be proven that we cannot do better.
