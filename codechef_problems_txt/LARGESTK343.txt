Largest K
You are given integers
X and
Y
(2≤X,Y≤10
9
).
Find the largest integer
K such that there exists a binary string
S, where:
The count of
0s in
S is
X;
The count of
1s in
S is
Y;
There are atleast
K
1s between any two occurrences of
0s in
S.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
X and
Y
− the number of
0s and
1s in
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the largest integer
K, such that a binary string satisfies given conditions.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The ideal binary string would be
011111111110 with
10 occurrences of
1 between two
0s.
Test case
2: The ideal binary string would be
01010 with at least
1 occurrence of
1 between any two
0s.
