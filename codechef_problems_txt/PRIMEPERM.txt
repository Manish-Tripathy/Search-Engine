Prime Permutation
Given an integer
N, find a permutation
P of length
N, such that:
∣P
i
−i∣ is prime for all
1≤i≤N.
If multiple such permutations exist, print any.
If no such permutation is possible, print
−1 instead.
Note:
A permutation of length
N contains all integers from
1 to
N exactly once.
∣X∣ denotes the absolute value of
X. For example,
∣−4∣=4 and
∣7∣=7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of an integer
N — the length of the required permutation.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line,
N space-separated integers, denoting a permutation satisfying the given condition.
If multiple such permutations exist, print any.
If no such permutation is possible, print
−1 instead.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: The two possible permutations of length
2 are
[1,2] and
[2,1]. Neither of these permutations satisfy the given condition.
Test case
2: Consider the permutation
[3,4,1,2]. The value of
∣P
i
−i∣ are
[∣3−1∣,∣4−2∣,∣1−3∣,∣2−4∣]=[2,2,2,2]. Here, all
∣P
i
−i∣ are prime.
Test case
3: Consider the permutation
[4,5,1,2,3]. The value of
∣P
i
−i∣ are
[∣4−1∣,∣5−2∣,∣1−3∣,∣2−4∣,∣3−5∣]=[3,3,2,2,2]. Here, all
∣P
i
−i∣ are prime.
