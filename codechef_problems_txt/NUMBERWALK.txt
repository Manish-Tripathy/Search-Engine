Number Walks
You are given an array
A of
N integers, and an integer
K such that
1≤A
i
≤K, and each integer
1,2…,K appears at least once in the array
A.
Suppose you start at some position
S (
1≤S≤N), solve the following problem:
A sequence of
(K+1) integers,
B
0
,B
1
,B
2
,…,B
K
is called good if it satisfies the following conditions:
B
0
=S
1≤B
i
≤N for each
1≤i≤K
A
B
i
=i for each
1≤i≤K
Among all good sequences, find the minimum possible value of
∑
i=1
K
∣B
i
−B
i−1
∣.
Less formally, we want a sequence starting at
S and then the next element is an occurrence of
1, the next an occurrence of
2, and so on till an occurrence of
K, and we should find the sequence that minimizes the total distance.
The starting position
S is not fixed, so you need to print the answer for each
S=1,2,…,N.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line contains
2 integers -
N and
K, the size of the array and the upper bound on the elements.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N integers - the answers if we started our sequence at
S for each
S=1,2,…,N in this order.
