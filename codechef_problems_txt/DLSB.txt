Make Bob Win
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have with them a binary string
S.
Alice and Bob alternate making moves, with Alice going first.
On their turn, a player does the following:
Choose a non-empty contiguous substring of
S all of whose characters are the same, delete it from
S, and concatenate the remaining parts.
More formally, choose integers
L and
R such that
1≤L≤R≤∣S∣ and
S
L
=S
L+1
=…=S
R
, and replace
S with the string
S
1
S
2
…S
L−1
S
R+1
S
R+2
…S
∣S∣
.
This reduces the length of
S by
R−L+1.
Alice wins immediately when
S doesn't contain any occurrence of
1, while Bob wins immediately when
S doesn't contain any occurrence of
0. Both players will play to win.
Note that if the string initially doesn't contain any occurrences of
0, Bob wins before any moves are made.
Bob wants to win the game, so before the game starts, he can flip some characters of
S.
That is, Bob can choose an index
i (
1≤i≤N), and set
S
i
to
0 if it was originally
1, and vice versa.
Find the minimum number of flips Bob needs to make to ensure he can win.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
N — the length of
S.
The second line contains the binary string
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of flips required in
S to make Bob win.

S is a binary string, i.e, contains only the characters
0 and
1.
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: Bob changes the only character of
S, resulting in
S=1.
There are no
0's in this string, so Bob wins automatically.
Test case
2: There are no
0's in the string, so Bob wins without having to change anything.
Test case
3: Bob can flip the first character of the string, turning it into
111001.
It can be shown that if the game is played on this string, Bob will win; whereas he would lose if the game is played on the initial string.
