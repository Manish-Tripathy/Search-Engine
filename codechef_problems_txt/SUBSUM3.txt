Subset Sum 3
You are given an array
A of
N integers. Determine if their exists a non-empty subsequence
†
†
of
A such that the sum is divisible by
3.
Print
Yes or
No accordingly. You do not need to print an example of such a subset.
†
†
B is said to be a subset of
A if
B can be formed by deleting some elements in
A without rearranging the order of the remaining elements. For example,
[1,2],
[1,1,2,3],
[2,3] are valid subsequences of
[1,1,2,3] but
[2,1] or
[2,2] is not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the size of the array.
The second line contains
N integers -
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line
Yes or
No depending on whether there exists a non-empty subsequence with sum divisible by
3 or not.
Each character can be printed in either case, i.e.
yes,
YES and
yES will all be accepted as positive responses.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : There is only one element, which is not divisible by
3.
Test Case 2 : There is only one element, which is divisible by
3.
Test Case 3 : We can take the whole array
[1,2] as that has a sum of
3.
