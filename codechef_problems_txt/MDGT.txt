Lost in the Fest!!
Bhoomi was excited for the annual fest at IIIT Pune. She found a spot in the queue, eagerly waiting for the performance. But there was a problem: tall students ahead blocked her view!
Frustrated, she wondered: "How much do I have to move to be able to see the performance?"
There are
N students who want to watch the performance at the fest. They're standing in a straight queue, and the
i-th student in the queue has a height of
H
i
.
A student will be able to watch the performance if and only if they are strictly taller than every student ahead of them.
That is, student
i will be able to watch the performance if and only if
H
i
>H
j
for every
1≤j<i.
Bhoomi is the last student in the queue, with a height of
H
N
.
Every second, she can swap places with the person just in front of her - that is, if she's currently at position
i,
she can move to position
i−1 (and the person previously at position
i−1 will move to position
i instead).
How many seconds will it take till Bhoomi is able to see the performance?
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of students in the queue.
The second line contains
N space-separated integers
H
1
,H
2
,…,H
N
, denoting the heights of the students in the queue.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the answer: the number of seconds till Bhoomi is able to see the performance.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The process is as follows.
Initially, Bhoomi is at position
N=6 with a height of
3, and cannot see the performance - for example,
H
5
=6 is greater than her height.
Second
1: Bhoomi moves to position
5, so the heights are now
[2,4,1,7,3,5]. Bhoomi still cannot see the performance.
Second
2: Bhoomi moves to position
4, so the heights are now
[2,4,1,3,7,5]. Bhoomi still cannot see the performance.
Second
3: Bhoomi moves to position
3, so the heights are now
[2,4,3,1,7,5]. Bhoomi still cannot see the performance.
Second
4: Bhoomi moves to position
2, so the heights are now
[2,3,4,1,7,5].
Bhoomi can now see the performance, so it took four seconds.
Test case
2: Bhoomi can see the performance from the start.
Test case
3: Bhoomi needs to move to the start of the queue to see the performance, which will take her three seconds.
