Minimise Maximum Subarray Sum
You are given two positive integers
X and
Y.
Consider an array
A consisting of
X occurrences of
1 and
Y occurrences of
−2.
You can rearrange the elements of
A in any order.
Rearrange the elements to minimize the maximum sum over all subarrays of
A.
Find the maximum subarray sum of such rearrangement of
A.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
X and
Y, denoting the number of occurrences of
1 and
−2 respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, print the maximum sum of subarray if you rearrange
A optimally.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Here either
A=[1,−2] or
A=[−2,1]. In both cases, maximum subarray sum is
1.
Test case
2: The array consists of one
1 and three
−2. Thus, maximum subarray sum would be
1.
Test case
3: Consider
A=[1,1,−2,1,1,1]. The maximum subarray sum here is
3.
