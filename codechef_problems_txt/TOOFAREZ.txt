Too Far For Comfort (Easy Version)
This is the easy version of TOOFAR, and is worth
40 points.
An array
A of length
M is said to be prefix-balanced under the following conditions:
Let
S
A
denote the set of all elements that appear in
A.
For each
x∈S
A
, and index
i (
1≤i≤M), let
f
i
(x) denote the number of times
x appears among
[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
].
That is,
f
i
(x) denotes the frequency of
x in
A's prefix of length
i.
Then,
A is called prefix-balanced if, for every triple of integers
(x,y,i) such that
x,y∈S
A
and
1≤i≤M, we have
∣f
i
(x)−f
i
(y)∣≤1
For example, the arrays
[1,2,1] and
[1,3,2,3] are prefix-balanced, but
[2,3,2,4] is not (the prefix of length
3 contains two occurrences of
2 and no occurrences of
4).
You are given two integers
N and
M.
There are
M
N
arrays of length
N whose elements lie between
1 and
M. How many of them are prefix-balanced?
The answer might be large, so find it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing two space-separated integers
N and
M.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the number of arrays of prefix-balanced arrays of length
N, whose elements lie in
[1,M]. Report the answer modulo
998244353.
Constraints

1≤N≤5⋅10

1≤M≤5⋅10

The sum of
N and the sum of
M over all test cases both won't exceed
5⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: There are
10 possible arrays, all of which are prefix-balanced.
Test case
2: There are
4
3
=64 possible arrays. Of them, the ones that are not prefix-balanced are:
[1,1,2],[1,1,3],[1,1,4],
[2,2,1],[2,2,3],[2,2,4],
[3,3,1],[3,3,2],[3,3,4],
[4,4,1],[4,4,2],[4,4,3].
Test case
4: The actual answer is
95235299341, which when taken modulo
998244353 is
402085806.
