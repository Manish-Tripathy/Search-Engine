Swaps in a String
You are given a string
S that contains of the characters
A,
B or
C only.
In one operation, you can do either of the following:
Choose an occurrence of
AB in the string, convert it to
BA.
Choose an occurrence of
BC in the string, convert it to
CB.
Note that you are only allowed to operate on adjacent elements.
Find the maximum number of operations you can do. It can be proven the answer is finite.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the length of the string.
The second line contains
S - the string.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of operations possible.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : We can convert
ABCC to
ACBC and then to
ACCB. More than
2 operations can be proven to be impossible.
Test Case 2 :
BAABB→BABAB→BBAAB→BBABA→BBBAA.
