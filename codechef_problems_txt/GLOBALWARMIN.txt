Global Warming
Chef is fighting global warming and so he is planting trees. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by a tree is equal to the height of the tree. Chef generates trees in a very weird way, and your task is to calculate the sum of amount of carbon dioxide absorbed over all possible ways of generating trees.
Given parameters
N and
K, Chef generates a tree with
N nodes numbered from
1 to
N using the following procedure :
First, generate an array
A=[A
1
,A
2
,....A
N−1
] of size
N−1 satisfying the following constraints :
1≤A
i
≤2
A
1
=1
The number of
A
i
=1 is precisely
K
Now, for all
i=1 to
N−1:
if
A
i
=1, add an edge between nodes numbered
i and
i+1
if
A
i
=2, add an edge between nodes numbered
i−1 and
i+1.
It can be proven that the end result is a tree.
The height of the tree is defined as the maximum distance of any node from the node
1. Find the sum of heights over all possible generatable trees. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first and only line contains
2 integers -
N and
K, the
2 parameters of generating trees.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the sum of heights of all generatable trees modulo
998244353.
Constraints
1≤T≤10

1≤K≤N−1
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test Case 1 : The only valid array
A is
[1,2] and the corresponding tree generated is
{(1,2),(1,3)} which has a height of
1.
Test Case 2 : The only valid array
A is
[1,1] and the corresponding tree generated is
{(1,2),(2,3)} which has a height of
2.
