Largest Subsequence
A string
S is called good if and only if :
The number of occurrences of "
ab" as a substring of
S
= the number of occurrences of "
ba" as a substring of
S.
For example,
aaba,
a and
babab are good strings, while
ab is not.
You are given a string
S consisting of characters
a and
b only. Find the length of the largest subsequence
†
†
of the string
S which is good.
†
†
T is said to be a subsequence of
S, if we can obtain
T by deleting some elements from
, and concatenating the remaining portion without changing their order. For example,
ab,
aa,
a and
aba are all subsequences of
aba, but
bb and
baa are not.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line contains
N - the size of the string
The second line contains
S - the string
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the length of the largest subsequence of
T which is good.

Explanation:
Test Case 1 :
abba has
1 occurrence of
ab and
1 occurrence of
ba. Thus, it is already a good string. Hence, the answer is simply
4.
Test Case 2 :
ab is not good as it has
1 occurrence of
ab but none of
ba.
a is a good string, which has size
1.
