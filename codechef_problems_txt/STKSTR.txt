Streak Star
The Streak Value of an array
B is defined as the maximum length of a non-decreasing subarray, more formally:
1≤i≤j≤N

Chef has an array
A of length
N and a magical number
X. You are allowed to perform the following operation at most once:
Select an index
i, and update the element at
A
i
by multiplying it with
X, i.e., set
A
i
:=A
i
⋅X
Your task is to find the maximum possible Streak Value achievable for array
A.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
X — the length of array and magical number respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible Streak Value of
A.

Explanation:
Test case
1: It is optimal to select index
3, which changes the array
A to
[1,2,3,4,2]. The Streak Value for the array
[1,2,3,4,2] is
4, as the longest non-decreasing subarray is
[1,2,3,4].
Test case
2: Its optimal to select index
3, which changes the array
A to
[2,5,30].
The Streak Value for the array
[2,5,30] is
3, as the entire array is already non-decreasing.
Test case
3: In this case, it is optimal to either not perform any operation or perform the operation on index
4, both of which result in a Streak Value of
3.
