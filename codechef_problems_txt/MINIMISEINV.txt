Minimise Inversions
You are given a binary string
S of length
N (1≤N≤5⋅10
3
) and an integer
K.
You can flip
†
†
at most
K characters of the string
S. Find the minimum number of inversions
‡
‡
in the final string.
†
†
During a flip,
0 changes to
1 and vice-versa.
‡

A pair of indices
(i,j) is said to be an inversion if
1≤i<j≤∣S∣ and
S

.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two positive integers
N and
K
− the length of
S and the number of flips that you can perform.
The second line of each test contains a binary string
S of length
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of inversions that you can get.

Explanation:
Test case
1: We can flip
S
1
using one flip to obtain
S=001 with zero inversions.
Test case
2: We can flip
S
1
using one flip to obtain
S=0010 with one inversion
(3,4). It can be shown that we cannot achieve less than one inversion using at most
1 flip.
