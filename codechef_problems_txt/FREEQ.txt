Frequal
An array
A of length
N is called frequal if, for each
i (
1≤i≤N), the frequency of
A
i
equals the number of its positive divisors.
For example,
[2,8,1,8,8,8,2] is a frequal array (
1 has one divisor,
2 has two divisors, and
8 has four divisors), while
[10,4,10,4,4,10] is not (
10 has four divisors but appears only three times in the array).
Let
f(A) denote the number of distinct elements in
A.
For instance,
f([1,1,1,1])=1, and
f([1,3,2,9,2,9,1])=4.
You are given an integer
N.
Find any frequal array
A of length
N such that
f(A) is as large as possible.
The array should satisfy
1≤A
i
≤10

.
It can be shown that such a frequal array always exists.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing one integer
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line
N space-separated integers representing a frequal array of length
N such that
f(A) is maximal.
Each integer in the output must lie between
1 and
10

.
If there are multiple possible arrays satisfying this condition, you may print any of them.
Constraints

1≤N≤2⋅10

The output must satisfy
1≤A

≤10

.
The sum of
N over all test cases won't exceed
2⋅10

Explanation:
Test case
1: We have
A=[2,2], which has
f(A)=1. It is frequal since
2 has two divisors.
It can be shown that no frequal array of length
2 can have two distinct elements.
Test case
2: Consider
A=[4,1,3,5,5,4,3,4]. It has four distinct elements.
Let's look at their frequencies and divisors:
1 has a single divisor (itself), and also appears only once.
3 has two divisors (
1 and
3), and appears twice.
4 has three divisors (
1,2,4), and also appears three times.
5 has two divisors (
1 and
5), and appears twice.
So, this array is frequal.
It can be shown that a frequal array of length
8 with
≥5 distinct elements doesn't exist, so this array is optimal.
