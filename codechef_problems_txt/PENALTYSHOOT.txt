Penalty Shoot-out
In a football match, a penalty shootout is used to determine the winner if the score is tied after regulation and extra time. Each team takes turns attempting five penalty kicks.
Team A has scored
X goals in
3 turns while team B has scored
Y goals in
4 turns.
Determine if it's possible for the penalty shootout to end with equal score after both teams have taken all
5 of their penalty kicks.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
X and
Y — the number of goals scored by team A in
3 turns and team B in
4 turns respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES if match can still end in draw, otherwise output NO.
You may print each character of the output in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).

Explanation:
Test case
1: Team A can score
1 and
0 goals in their
4
th
and
5
th
turn respectively and team B can score
0 goals in
5
th
turn.
This way the final score of penalty for both teams would be
2.
Test case
2: Even if team B scores a goal in
5
th
turn, their total would be
1, which is less than the score of team A.
Test case
3: Team A can score
0 and
1 goal in their
4
th
and
5
th
turn respectively and team B can score
1 goal in
5
th
