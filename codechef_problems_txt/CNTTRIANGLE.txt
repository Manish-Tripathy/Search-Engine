Counting Triangles 101
A set
S is said to be good iff :
For all
x,y,z∈S, such that
x

=y,x

=z,y

=z;
(x,y,z) are the side lengths of a valid non-degenerate triangle.
Count the number of sets
S of
N distinct integers which are good, and all elements of the set
S
i
satisfy
1≤S
i
≤M.
Since the answer may be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers
N and
M — the size of the set
S, and the upper bound on the elements of set
S.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, a single integer denoting the number of good sets modulo
10
9
+7.
Constraints
1≤T≤10
4
3≤N≤M≤10
6
The sum of
M does not exceed
10
6
over all test cases.

Explanation:
Test case
1 : The only valid set is
S={2,3,4}.
{1,3,4} is invalid as there doesn't exist a triangle with side lengths
1,3, and
4.
