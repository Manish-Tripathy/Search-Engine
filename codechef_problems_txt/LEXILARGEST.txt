Lexicographically Largest
You are given a positive integer
M and an array
A (1≤A
i
≤M) consisting of
N positive integers.
Find the lexicographically largest array
B such that:
∣B∣=N;
1≤B
i
≤M for all
1≤i≤N;
A
i
=gcd(B
1
,B
2
,…,B
i
), where
gcd denotes the greatest common divisor.
Note that the input
A guarantees that
B always exists.
For two arrays
X and
Y, both of size
N, the array
X is said to be lexicographically larger than array
Y, if, in the first position where
X and
Y differ,
X
i
>Y
i
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers
N and
M — the length of array
A and upper bound on array elements.
The next line contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A

representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the lexicographically largest array
B, satisfying the given conditions.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The only possible array is
B=[1] which satisfies the given conditions.
Test case
2: The only possible array is
B=[2,1] which satisfies the given conditions.
Here

)=1.
Test case
4: The lexicographically largest valid array is
B=[2,4,4,4]. Some other arrays that are valid include
[2,2,2,2],[2,2,4,2],[2,2,4,4].
