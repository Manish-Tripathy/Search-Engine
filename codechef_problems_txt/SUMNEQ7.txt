Sum Neq
You are given an array
A containing
N (4≤N≤2⋅10
5
) positive integers.
Check whether there exist
4 distinct indices
i,j,k, and
l such that:
1≤i<j<k<l≤N

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a positive integer
N, the length of the array
A.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

,A
2
,…,A
N
representing the array
A.
Output Format
For each test case, output YES if there exist
4 such indices. Otherwise print NO.
You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings YES, yEs, yes, and yeS will all be treated as identical).
