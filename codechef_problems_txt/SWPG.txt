Shall we play a game
Alice and Bob play a game over
N rounds, starting with an initial score of
0. Alice takes the first turn.
In the
i
th
round (
1≤i≤N), the current player must either add or subtract
2
i−1
from the current score.
As the game progresses, let:
X be the maximum score reached at any point.
Y be the minimum score reached at any point.
Alice’s goal is to minimize the final difference
−, while Bob aims to maximize it.
Assuming both players play optimally, determine the final value of
X−Y after all
N rounds. Since this value can be very large, output it modulo
998244353.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists a single line of input.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
N — the number of rounds played.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing one integer — the final value of
X−Y modulo
998244353.

Explanation:
Test Case 1: Alice increases/decreases the score by 1, so the final value of
X−Y=1.
Test Case 2: Alice increases/decreases the score by 1. In his turn, Bob increases the score to 3 if the score after the first round is 1 or decreases it to -3, if it is -1. In either case, the final value of
X−Y is 3.
