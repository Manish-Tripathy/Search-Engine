Equal Pairs (Hard)
This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, the array
A is changing. The constraint on
N is also larger:
N≤2⋅10
5
.
For an array
A containing non-negative integers, we define
f(A) as follows:
First, for each index
i such that
A
i
=0, replace
A
i
by an arbitrary positive integer of your choice.
Then, calculate the number of pairs
(i,j) such that
i<j and
A
i
=A
j
.
That is, the number of pairs of distinct indices that contain the same value.
Let this value be
P.
f(A) is then the maximum possible value of
P if you choose the replacements of the zeros appropriately.
You have an array
A of size
N, initially filled with
0's.
You have to handle the following
N events:
Given
X and
Y, update
A
X
=Y. Then, find
f(A).
It is guaranteed that all
N events have distinct values of
X - that is, each index will be updated exactly once.
Note that when computing
f(A), we don't actually replace the zeros in
A: we just want to know the maximum possible value of
P if we replaced the zeros appropriately.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains
N - the size of the array.
The next
N lines each contain
2 integers
X and
Y - meaning we must update
A
X
=Y.
Output Format
For each test case, output
N space-separated integers on a single line - the value of
f(A) after each of the
N events.

Explanation:
Test case
1: The initial array
A is
[0,0,0,0].
After the first event, the array
A is
[0,0,2,0].
We have to modify all the
0 elements in array
A. We can change them all to get
2 to get
[2,2,2,2] which has
6 equal pairs, which is the best we can do.
After the second event, the array
A is
[1,0,2,0].
The zeros can be filled in to obtain
[1,1,2,1] which has
3 equal pairs.
