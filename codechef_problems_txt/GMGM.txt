Gun Master
You have two guns: a close-range gun and a long-range gun.
The close-range gun can only shoot targets at distances less than or equal to
D, while the long-range gun can only shoot targets at distances strictly greater than
D.
You can only hold one gun at a time. Initially, you are holding the close-range gun.
You need to shoot at a series of
N targets in order. The distance to the
i-th target is
A
i
.
Your task is to determine the minimum number of times you need to switch between the two guns to shoot all
N targets in the given order.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
N and
D — the number of targets and the maximum effective range of the close-range gun.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the minimum number of gun switches required.

Explanation:
Test case
1:
D=2, so you can shoot at targets at distances
≤2 using the close-range gun.
The targets are at distances
[2,1,3,4], so the first two can be shot using the close-range gun and the last two using the long-range gun.
Only one switch is needed, between the second and third targets.
Test case
2:
D=1, and the targets are at distances
[2,3,4,1].
The long-range gun must be used for the first three targets, and the close-range gun for the last target.
Since you're initially holding the close-range gun, two switches are required - before shooting the first target, and after shooting the third target.
Test case
3: All targets can be shot using the close-range gun, so no switches are necessary.
