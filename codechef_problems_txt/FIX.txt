Prefixing
Given an array
A of size
N, construct an array
B of size
N such that :
Every element of
B is present at least once in
A;
For all
1≤i≤N, every element in prefix
[A
1
,A
2
,…,A
i
] is present at least once in prefix
[B
1
,B
2
,…,B
i
].
If multiple such arrays
B exist, find the lexicographically largest
B.
Note that for two arrays
X and
Y, each of size
N, where
i is the smallest index at which they differ, array
X is said to be lexicographically larger than array
Y when
X
i
>Y
i
.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
N — the number of elements in the array.
The second line of each test case contains
N space-separated integers
A
1
,A
2
,…,A
N
— the elements of the array.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, lexicographically largest array
B satisfying the conditions.
It can be guaranteed that one such array
B always exists.

Explanation:
Test case
1: Consider
B=[5,5,2,3]. Every element of
B is present at least once in
A.
i=1: Prefix of
A is
[5] and
B is
[5]. Every element in prefix of
A is present in prefix of
B at least once.
i=2: Prefix of
A is
[5,5] and
B is
[5,5].
i=3: Prefix of
A is
[5,5,2] and
B is
[5,5,2].
i=4: Prefix of
A is
[5,5,2,3] and
B is
[5,5,2,3].
Also, this is the lexicographically largest possible
B.
Test case
2: Consider
B=[8,9]. Every element of
B is present at least once in
A.
i=1: Prefix of
A is
[8] and
B is
[8].
i=2: Prefix of
A is
[8,9] and
B is
[8,9].
Also, this is the lexicographically largest possible
B.
Test case
3: It can be proved that this is the lexicographically largest possible
B.
