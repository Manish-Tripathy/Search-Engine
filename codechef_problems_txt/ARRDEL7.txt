Delete The Array
Given an integer
K, consider an array
A of size
N. You can perform the following operation on the array:
Select an integer
X;
Remove all elements from
A satisfying
X≤A
i
<X+K.
Let
f(A) denote the minimum number of such operations needed to make the array
A empty, i.e. delete all of its elements.
Given integers
N and
M, find the sum of
f(A) over all strictly increasing arrays
A of size
N satisfying
1≤A
i
≤M.
Since the answer may be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7.
Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of three space-separated integers,
N,
M and
K, as mentioned in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the required sum of minimum operations of all such arrays modulo
10

+7.
Constraints

Explanation:
Test case
1: Since
K=1, each operation can delete atmost
1 element, thus clearly we need
N operations per array, and there are
5 arrays, hence the answer is
5⋅4=20.
Test case
2: There are
3 possible arrays :
[1,2] : We use one operation with
X=1, thus
f([1,2])=1.
[2,3] : We use one operation with
X=2, thus
f([2,3])=1.
[1,3] : We must use at least
2 operations, and we can do that by first choosing
X=1 and then
X=2, thus
f([1,3])=2.
Thus, sum of
f(A) is
4.
